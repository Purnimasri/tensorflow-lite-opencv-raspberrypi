# tensorflow-lite-opencv-raspberrypi
I built a real-time object classification system on a Raspberry Pi using TensorFlow Lite and OpenCV. The project uses the COCO SSD MobileNet model to detect and classify objects in real-time. I also set up a virtual environment on the Raspberry Pi to keep everything running smoothly and optimized the model for low-power use.
