Object Classification on Raspberry Pi
Project Description

This project focuses on real-time object detection using TensorFlow Lite and OpenCV on a Raspberry Pi. It employs the COCO SSD MobileNet model for efficient object recognition with live camera input.

Tools Used

TensorFlow Lite

OpenCV

Features

Real-time Object Detection: Utilized the COCO SSD MobileNet model for detecting multiple objects from live camera input.

Optimized for Raspberry Pi: Configured for efficient performance on low-power devices.

Virtual Environment Setup: Configured a virtual environment on the Raspberry Pi to manage dependencies and ensure smooth execution.

Edge Device Optimization: Optimized model performance for deployment on low-power edge devices.
